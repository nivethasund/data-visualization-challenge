## Module 5 Challenge Files

This repo contains the main Pymaceuticals folder, in which you'll find
- The main script used on Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
- The data folder containing original data files (.csv)
    -  Mouse_metadata
    -  Study_results
 
## Pyceuticals

With the help of Pandas, Matplotlib, and the starter file, I merged and analyzed the mouse data with the study results. The goal of this analysis was to apply what I've learned during the span of this module, in addition to using statistical calculations to draw the most accurate conclusions from the data provided. The data gives us an overview of a list of mice that have been given specific drugs in order to study their efficacy in reducing the presence of squamous cell carcinoma tumors. In my analysis, I
- prepare the data
- provide a summary analysis
- plot bar charts and pie graphs using Pandas and Matplotlib
- calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create boxplots
- create line and scatter plots
- calculate correlation and regression
